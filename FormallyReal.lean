/- ## Sums of squares

To define formally real semirings, we first define what it means to be a sum of squares in a semiring. -/

def sum_of_squares {R : Type _} [Semiring R] : List R → R
  | [] => 0
  | (a :: L) => (a ^ 2) + (sum_of_squares L)

lemma sum_of_squares_eq_map_sum {R : Type _} [Semiring R] (L : List R) :
    sum_of_squares L = (L.map (.^2)).sum := by
  induction' L with r L hL
  · simp [sum_of_squares]
  · simp [hL, sum_of_squares] 

def is_sum_of_squares {R : Type _} [Semiring R] (x : R) : Prop := ∃ L : List R, sum_of_squares L = x

/- A few sanity checks -/

#check [1, 2, 3]
#check [1, -2, 3]

#eval sum_of_squares [1, 2, 3]
#eval sum_of_squares [1, -2, 3]

#eval sum_of_squares ([] : List ℕ)

/- Note that we can prove that `sum_of_squares [1, 2, 3] = 14` just by using `rfl` -/

example : sum_of_squares [1, 2, 3] = 14 := rfl

/- If a list is built by concatenation, we can compute its sum of squares from the sums of squares of each constructor. -/

#eval 0::[1,2,3]
#eval [1,2,3]++[1,2,3]

#eval sum_of_squares (0::[1,2,3])
#eval sum_of_squares ([1,2,3]++[1,2,3])

/- We now give a proof of these results, as well as of other useful facts about sums of squares. -/

/- ## Properties of formally real semirings 

We first want to show that, if `R` is a *non-trivial* formally real *ring*, then `-1` is not a sum of squares in `R`. We deduce this from the more general fact that, if `R` is a formally real nontrivial *semiring*, then there does *not* exist a sum of squares `S` in `R` such that `1 + S = 0`.-/

 /- ## Formally real semifields 
 
 We prove that, in a semifield, the converse to `one_add_sum_of_squares_neq_zero` holds, namely: if there is no sum of squares `S` such that `1 + S = 0`, then the semifield `F` is formally real. -/
